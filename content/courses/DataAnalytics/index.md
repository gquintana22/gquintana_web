The swine and poultry industries generate enormous amount of information. This could be used to register historical series or as a data base to generate information to improve the results and plan future developments.

Analytical thinking sets the foundation for proper decision making. This process should consider the identification of the problem, the appropriate data collection, the statistical or analytical analysis, the interpretation and communication of the results, and the proper decision making. 

The course uses practical examples from the industry and real data shared by some of the main integrations of the world. Utilizes JMP, R and Tableau software with poultry and swine examples.  Opens the opportunity for customized data analytic projects.
